This directory contains two test scripts, `demo1.ts' and `demo2.ts'.
Both describe tests for the package `Under_Test', which contains a
single routine `Subject'.  This package is provided in the files
`under_test.ad[bs]'.

To use, first build the `tg' program.  Put it somewhere on your path,
then type

  tg demo1.ts
  gnatmake demo1

This creates a file `demo1.adb', the Ada source code of the driver
that was specified in `demo1.ts'.  The `gnatmake' command compiles
this driver, and the test item (package Under_Test), and links them
together into the executable `demo1'.  Run it by typing

  demo1

This should produce the output


  (1) pass.
  (2) pass.
  (3) pass.
  (4) pass.
  (5) pass.

  Total test result: pass.


Do the same for `demo2.ts'.  This file contains test cases that are
*supposed* to fail.  The output should be


  (1)  X = 1
        ...FAIL.
           (path `=>' was taken, but predicate is FALSE)
              **Actual Result:  1
  ERROR: exception UNDER_TEST.STRANGE_ERROR raised in prepare part of test case 2.
  (2) pass.
  (3) pass.
  ERROR: exception CONSTRAINT_ERROR raised in cleanup part of test case 3.
  (4) pass.
  (5)  X = 5
        ...FAIL.
           (path `UNDER_TEST.ILLEGAL_PARAMETER' when `=>' was expected)

  Total test result: FAIL,
          there were one or more unexpected errors
